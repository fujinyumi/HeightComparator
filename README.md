# HeightComparator

A simple page to generate heights visually.
A work in progress.
To be added later:
- Click and drag option, to move around individual images as desired
- Automatic sort option, for both tallest to shortest and vice versa
- Hopefully, arbitrariness by allowing users to upload their own specifications in height, image, etc.
